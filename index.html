      <p>
        Terry Fox, the <strong> one-legged runner </strong>from
        <strong><i>Port Coquitlam, British Columbia</i></strong>, made an indelible impression upon people across Canada and around the
        world. An outstanding athlete with a stubborn and competitive spirit, he
        lost his leg to cancer at 19, but said “nobody is ever going to call me
        a quitter.”
      </p>
      <p>
        On <strong>April 12, 1980</strong>, Terry Fox set out from St. John’s,
        Newfoundland to begin the run across Canada that he named the Marathon
        of Hope. His ambition was to raise a million dollars for cancer
        research. It wasn’t easy. Initial support from communities varied from
        terrific to nothing at all. His prosthetic leg was painful to run on,
        and there were always traffic and extreme weather conditions to deal
        with. But, by the time he reached Ontario – a journey of more than
        <i><strong>3,000 kilometres</i></strong> – word of his achievement had spread, and
        thousands cheered him and followed his progress. Terry’s spirits soared,
        and now he hoped to raise $22 million dollars – one dollar for every
        Canadian. He succeeded in this ambition, but the Marathon of Hope ended
        near Thunder Bay, Ontario on September 1, 1980. The cancer had spread to
        his lungs, and, after running 24 miles in one day, on the next he could
        run no further.
      </p>
      <p>
        When cancer finally claimed his life in <strong>1981</strong>, Canada
        mourned the loss of a hero, but the Terry Fox Marathon of Hope lives on.
        The Terry Fox Foundation raised more than $17 million in 1999, and
        support for the event nationally and around the world is growing.
